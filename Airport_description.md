My soundscape narrative follows a girl as she finds her way through a busy airport. Throughout the whole plot, there is sounds of music and talking playing softly in the background. The girl's conscience is also talking in the background as well. She first gets out of the cab that took her to the airport and tips the driver. Since she is not checking in any bags, she checks in on the kiosk device and that prints out her ticket, which is a sound that I added. Then, she walks over to the security line and patiently waits for all of her belongings to be checked. This is where her interaction with the security guard happens; she asks to see a photo ID and her plane ticket. Following this, she decides to use the bathroom, which is where I added my own recordings of the toilet flushing and sink water running. After, she goes to her gate and waits there; noise from a cafe nearby is playing during this scene. The soundscape narrative ends with her boarding the plane, with a loud noise of an air conditioner added in, and then finally the take off. You hear a voice, the piolet, saying they are taking off, and the girl's conscience talks one last time.
